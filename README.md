# desktop-video
App to get a light cpu and gpu load video desktop wallpaper on Windows 10.

## Installation
It requires no other installation than install [ffmpeg and ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and set their paths in environment variables, to make them accessible as command in the cmd.

## How to use it
For now the only thing you have to do is compile it, and run it with the path of the video you want in background after the command.
If you want to tweak the position on the screen the target resolution, or other parameters, the only way is to change values in the code, or change the code, and recompile.
