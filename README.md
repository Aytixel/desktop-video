# desktop-video
App to get a light load video desktop wallpaper on Windows 10.

## Installation
As it uses VLC you need to copy the plugins directory from ***C:\Program Files\VideoLan\VLC*** where the executable is located.

## How to use it
For now the only thing you have to do is compile it, and run it with the path of the video you want in background after the command.
If you want to tweak some parameter, the only way is to change values in the code, or change the code, and recompile.
